/*!
 * The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
 *
 *     n -> n / 2 (if n is even)
 *     n -> 3n + 1 (if n is odd)
 *
 * Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
 *
 *     13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
 *
 * It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1)
 * contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Conjecture),
 * it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
 *
 * Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
 *
 * Note: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
